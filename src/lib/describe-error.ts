/**
 * Turning a refusal into a sentence a member can read, never the database's own words.
 *
 * Helpers call this **before** the error becomes a string: only the `code` (SQLSTATE or
 * `PGRST…`) tells cases apart honestly (a mentor's invite fails as 42501 or 23505).
 *
 * Our own `raise exception` messages are already prose and pass through untouched (`P0001`,
 * `P0002`, `22023`, or `42501` without "row-level security"). The database's and PostgREST's are
 * translated by code, real strings in describe-error.test.ts; `42501` also needs the phrase, as
 * policies, missing grants and our own raises share it. An unknown code gets a generic sentence
 * plus `console.error`. No code and no known phrase is taken as ours: PostgREST always sends one.
