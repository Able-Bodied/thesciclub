/**
 * What a push turns into on the lock screen, and where tapping it goes.
 *
 * Pure, and shared: the service worker imports it to show a notification, and
 * the tests import it without a service worker anywhere near them. `src/sw.ts`
 * is the thin half that touches `self`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every push shows something
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The subscription is `userVisibleOnly`, and Safari has said of the Mac that a
 * push which shows no notification can cost the subscription. The iOS post is
 * silent on it, so this assumes the worst: a payload that is missing, is not
 * JSON, or has no title still produces a notification. The fallback names the
 * club and nothing else — it is what a lock screen says when we do not know
 * what happened, and a lock screen is read by whoever is next to it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The sender decides the words, and this does not add any
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What a notification may say — "Bo sent you a message", with or without the
 * message — is the sender's decision and the member's switch, not this file's.
 * So nothing here reaches for a body the payload did not carry.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The address is ours or it is home
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A tap opens `url`. Anything that is not a path on this origin — another
 * site, `javascript:`, a protocol-relative `//elsewhere` — becomes `/`. The
 * sender is ours, but a notification that can open an arbitrary address is a
 * phishing page one bug away.
