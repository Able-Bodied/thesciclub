/**
 * Keeps a list where it was put while what is in it grows, until the reader
 * moves it themselves.
 *
 * A conversation used to jump to its newest message once, when the messages
 * arrived, and then its photographs loaded. Each one is drawn at its own size
 * only once its signed address has been asked for and the file has come, so
 * every picture above the bottom pushed the newest message further down, and
 * the member was left looking at a photograph (the owner, 2026-10-06). A topic
 * opened at a post had the same fault.
 *
 * So `hold(place)` says where the list should be, and runs `place` again
 * every time the content changes size. It lets go the moment the reader does
 * anything to the list themselves — a wheel, a touch, a press, a key — because
 * from then on the list is where they put it, and moving it under them is the
 * worse fault. Scroll events cannot tell the reader's scroll from ours, which
 * is why it listens for the reader's hands instead.
 *
 * With no ResizeObserver (jsdom, an old browser) the first placing is all
 * there is, which is what the app did before.
 *
 * `ready` is whether the two elements are drawn yet: both screens draw a
 * loading line first, and a ref does not say when it is filled.
