/**
 * Brings an installed app up to date after a deploy, without reinstalling.
 *
 * The service worker already takes over as soon as a new one arrives
 * (`skipWaiting` + `clientsClaim` in src/sw.ts). That left two gaps, and
 * members had to clear the app to get past them:
 *
 * - A browser looks for a new `sw.js` only when a page loads. An installed
 *   app comes back from the background without loading anything, so it
 *   could go days without looking. This asks on every return to the
 *   foreground, and every half hour while the app stays open.
 * - When the new worker took over, the screen kept running the old code
 *   until something reloaded it. This reloads, at a moment that loses
 *   nothing: at once if the app is in the background, or if it has only
 *   just come back and nobody has touched it yet; otherwise the next time
 *   it goes to the background, so a half-typed message is never thrown away.
 *
 * The first worker ever installed also takes over, and that is not an
 * update: a page with no worker in control when it opened does not reload.
 *
 * As a last resort (the owner, 2026-11-01: a Home Screen app still old after
 * being closed and opened): each check also reads /version.json, which the
 * worker does not keep. Still behind a minute after noticing, the app empties
 * its copy of the site and reloads from the network, at the same safe moments,
 * and once for each release so a bad deploy cannot loop. The worker itself
 * stays registered: unregistering it would end the member's notifications.
 *
 * Started once from main.tsx, outside React, since it belongs to the page's
 * whole life. Not in the store app, which has no worker and updates from the
 * store.
