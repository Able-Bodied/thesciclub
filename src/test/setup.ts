 * Unmount between tests.

 * Testing Library registers this itself only when Vitest's `globals` are on.
 * They are not, so without this every `render` stacks another copy of the

 * finds the previous test's markup instead. That fails honest tests and, worse,
 * passes dishonest ones.

/**
 * No test may reach the network.
 *
 * Three times while Chat was built, a screen test called an unstubbed
 * `@/lib/chat` hook, the hook called the real Supabase client, and the client
 * talked to the **hosted project** — because `.env.local` points there and
 * Vitest loads it like any other Vite process. Every one of those tests was
 * green: the read succeeded against production data, or failed slowly and was
 * swallowed by the hook's error path. The fix each time was one more `vi.mock`,
 * which fixes the test somebody noticed and not the class of fault.
 *
 * So the guard is here instead, once, for every test file. `fetch` and
 * `WebSocket` throw with the URL in the message, so a test that reaches for the
 * network fails on its first request and says where it was going. The cure is
 * always the same: stub the hook the screen actually calls.
 *
 * If a test ever has a legitimate reason to serve a request, it stubs `fetch`
 * itself with `vi.stubGlobal` — which is a decision in the file that needs it,
 * visible in review, rather than a door left open for everybody.
