/**
 * Turning a date-ordered list of events into one row per repeating event.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is worth doing at all
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The calendar is made of far fewer events than it has rows. Measured against
 * the live feed: 115 upcoming rows are 34 distinct events, and three of them
 * are most of the difference — Staying Driven repeats 27 times, the Friday
 * Happy Hour and Weekly Wednesdays 15 each. A member scanning the default
 * thirty-day window meets the same wheelchair fitness class nine times before
 * reaching anything else.
 *
 * Listing every occurrence is still correct for a calendar — you want to know
 * when *this* Friday's happy hour is — so the problem is scanning rather than
 * correctness, and the answer is to show the next one and say how many more
 * there are, not to hide the rest.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Counted within the window, never across the whole series
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The events handed in are already filtered — by segment, by date window, by
 * every chip in the sheet. The count and the last date come from those and
 * nothing else, so "8 more dates" always means eight rows that expanding will
 * actually show. Reading the whole series instead would put 27 on a card whose
 * expansion offers nine, under a window the member chose.

   * the whole one-off half of the calendar into a single row.

/**
 * How often a group repeats, in the member's words, or null when there is not
 * enough of it to say.
 *
 * Derived here and never stored. A cadence is a property of the occurrences in
 * front of somebody — inside a seven-day window a weekly series has one gap and
 * a monthly one has none — so a stored answer would disagree with the list it
 * sits in.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The statistic is a mean with the largest gap dropped, and both halves matter
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A plain mean is wrong because a holiday skips a week and doubles one gap:
 * [7, 14, 7, 7] averages 8.75 and renames a weekly class.
 *
 * A median is wrong in a way that took a failing test to see. Staying Driven
 * runs Wednesdays and Mondays, so its gaps alternate 5, 2, 5, 2 — and the
 * median of an alternating series is whichever value the middle lands on, so it
 * answers 3.5 with eight gaps and 5 with five gaps. The same event changes
 * rhythm depending on how many occurrences the window happens to hold.
 *
 * Dropping the single largest gap and averaging the rest survives both: the
 * holiday is the outlier it removes, and an alternating pattern keeps its shape
 * whatever the parity. [7, 14, 7, 7] gives 7, and 5, 2, 5, 2 gives 3.5 at any
 * length.
 *
 * Two occurrences give one gap, and one gap is not a rhythm — it is a
 * coincidence with a number attached. Two climbing meet-ups two days apart were
 * being announced as "Daily". Three occurrences before anything is named.
 *
 * Anything not near a familiar rhythm gets "Repeats" rather than an invented
 * word for it.
