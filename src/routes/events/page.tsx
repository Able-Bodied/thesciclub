/**
 * Events — what there is to go to, from the partner organizations' own
 * calendars.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is a column and not the full shell
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Peers grids its cards into the shell's full width, because a deck is
 * something you scan. A calendar is something you read down: one event after
 * another in date order, and the order is the content. Stretched to 1100px
 * every card's title, chips, host and buttons sit at wildly different x
 * positions, so following the list means sweeping the eye — and every RSVP
 * means dragging the pointer — right across the screen.
 *
 * That cost is not evenly shared. A member with a cervical injury may be
 * driving this with a head pointer, a mouth stick or a trackball, where
 * distance is effort rather than a flick of the wrist. So the column is capped
 * at a comfortable reading measure: wider than the phone, nowhere near the
 * window, and the same shape on every screen.
 *
 * Most events here were published by somebody else and ingested
 * (jobs/event-ingest). From 2026-10-05 an administrator, or a member who
 * speaks for an organization, can also add one by hand (event-form.tsx). Every
 * member can ask to add an organization, so the + is for everybody.
 *
 * The segments are the mock's, from `evPage()`. Organizations is the odd one:
 * it is not a narrowing of the list but a different body entirely, because the
 * mock treats the directory of organizations as part of this tab rather than as
 * a tab of its own.
 *
 * The header is two rows, to leave the screen to the list or the map (the
 * owner, 2026-11-01): what to look at and how, then search, filters and +.
 */

/**
 * A toggle: the calendar and the organizations (the owner, 2026-10-10).
 *
 * There were seven. Going, Interested and Been to are the member's own RSVPs,
 * and are now "Your RSVP" in Filters, beside the other ways of narrowing the
 * list; Adaptive sport and Online were narrowings the sheet already had (the
 * Sport tags, and "Getting there"). The URL still names the RSVP list, so
 * Me's counters link straight to it.
