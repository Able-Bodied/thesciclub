/**
 * The mark an organization is recognised by, on an event card or its own page.
 *
 * Three states, in order of preference: the organization's own logo, its short
 * code in the club's gold tile, or — for a host the club has no organization
 * for — letters derived from the name the feed gave.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The fallback is the point
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The logo now comes from our own bucket rather than the organization's CDN,
 * but the fallback matters just as much: five of the six organizations have no
 * logo at all, local development runs with the storage service switched off
 * entirely, and a file can always go missing. A badge that renders as a
 * broken-image glyph reads as this app being broken, so `onError` drops back to
 * the tile and the row looks deliberate either way.
 *
 * That is also why the tile is rendered underneath rather than instead of the
 * image — there is no flash of nothing while it loads.

          simply less obvious before the tile started scaling. CDRF and WWM are
          real: an organization's own short code is whatever its row says, and
          `shortCodeFor` takes up to four initials from a name. Shrunk in `em`
          so it stays proportional at every setting rather than pinned to one.

          Three gets a step of its own because letter widths are not equal:
          NCS fits where WWM does not, and a rule that measured characters
          rather than counting them would be a lot of machinery for a tile
          holding at most four of them. */}
