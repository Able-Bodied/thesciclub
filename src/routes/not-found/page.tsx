/**
 * The page for an address that is not one.
 *
 * It sits inside the shell, so the tab bar is still there and the way out is a
 * tap rather than the back button. Before this, an unknown path under `/*`
 * matched the shell, found no route inside it, and rendered the nav over an
 * empty page — no message, no error, nothing to act on.
 *
 * Only a signed-in member reaches it. A visitor without a member row is sent to
 * `/join` by `RequireMember` before routing gets this far, which is the right
 * answer for them: the club cannot tell a mistyped address from a probe, and
 * the door is the same either way.
 *
 * There is no HTTP status behind this. The app is a single page and the host
 * rewrites every path to index.html, deliberately — see netlify.toml, where
 * that rewrite is what stops a reload of /peers 404ing. So this is what "not
 * found" looks like here, and the noindex header covers the crawler half.
