/**
 * A mentor's own invites.

 * Reading and withdrawing go straight to the `invites` table, because two
 * policies already say exactly that much and nothing more:
 *
 *   mentors can see invites they sent          (select, own rows only)
 *   mentors can revoke their own pending       (update, pending rows only)
 *
 * So there is no select filter on `invited_by_member_id` below and no
 * ownership check before withdrawing; the database is the permission check.
 *
 * Adding one is different since email sign-in: a client can no longer insert
 * into `invites` at all. `create_my_invite` does it, with the same allowance
 * rules the insert policy used to hold, and `send-invite` emails the link.
 * supabase/tests/mentor-invites.sql runs all of it as a real mentor session.
