      <Section title="The club">
        <P>
          The SCI Club is a private community for adults living with spinal cord injury and their
          family members, operated by Alfred Shaheen (“we”, “us”). By joining or using it you agree
          to these terms and to the{' '}
          <Link to="/privacy" className="font-semibold text-emphasis underline">
            Privacy Policy
          </Link>
          .
        </P>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Membership">
        <List>
          <li>
            <b>Invite only.</b> A member organization or a mentor puts your email address on the
            club’s list, and the club emails you a link, before you can join. The app cannot let you
            in by itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Adults only.</b> You must be 18 or over.
          </li>
        </List>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Not medical advice">
        <P>
          Members share their own experience, and that is what makes the club worth having. But
          nothing here is medical advice, from members, mentors or organizations. Every body is
          different. Before you change your care, your medications or your equipment, check with
          your own doctor or care team.
        </P>
        <P>
          <b>In an emergency, call 911.</b>
        </P>
      </Section>

      <Section title="What is not allowed">
        <P>Objectionable content is anything that:</P>
        <List>
          <li>threatens, harasses, bullies or humiliates anyone;</li>
          <li>
            attacks people for their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, sex, sexual orientation,
            gender identity, age or where they come from;
          </li>
          <li>is pornographic, or is sexual and sent to someone who did not ask for it;</li>
          <li>shows or encourages violence, self-harm or anything illegal;</li>
          <li>shares somebody else’s private details or photographs without their permission;</li>
          <li>pretends to be somebody else;</li>
          <li>sells, advertises or spams.</li>
        </List>
        <P>
          Talking frankly about bodies, bladder and bowel care, and sex after injury is part of the
          club, and welcome.
        </P>
        <P>
          <b>The club has zero tolerance for objectionable content and for abusive members.</b>
        </P>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Losing your membership">
        <P>Membership can be taken away. Any of these will end it:</P>
        <List>
          <li>Selling to members.</li>
          <li>Harassing anyone.</li>
          <li>Giving medical advice as fact.</li>
          <li>Repeating outside a room what was said in it.</li>
        </List>
        <P>
          Posting objectionable content can end it too. We may remove anything that breaks these
          terms, give a strike (it shows on your Standing card, on Me), pause a membership, or end
          it.
        </P>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Reporting and blocking">
        <P>
          <b>We review every report within 24 hours and act on it.</b>
        </P>
        <List>
          <li>
            <b>To report</b> a message, a post or a reply, press the <b>•••</b> beside it and choose{' '}
            <b>Report</b>. Administrators see only that one message, with who wrote it and when. The
            person reported is not told. To report a member’s profile, press the <b>•••</b> on it
            and choose <b>Report</b>: administrators see a copy of it as it was then, photograph
            included, and the member is not told. To report anything else, email <ContactEmail />.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>To block</b> a member, press the <b>•••</b> on their profile, or beside anything they
            wrote, and choose <b>Block</b>. You stop seeing what they write, neither of you can
            message the other, and nothing they do notifies you. They are not told; administrators
            are. Unblock them at any time from <b>Me → Settings → Blocked members</b>.
          </li>
        </List>
      </Section>

      <Section title="What you write">
        <P>
          What you write is yours. By posting it, you let the club keep it and show it to the
          members who can read where you posted it. Post only what is yours to share.
        </P>
        <P>
          Members cannot rename or delete a room once it is started; administrators can close a
          room, and can remove a post or a topic that should not be there. If you delete your
          account, what you wrote in Chat stays and says “Deleted member” instead of your name,
          until the other person in a one-to-one conversation deletes it.
        </P>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Events and other sites">
        <P>
          Events in the club are run by the organizations and people who host them, not by us. A
          link to another site opens that site, under its own terms.
        </P>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Email">
        <P>
          <b>What the club emails you.</b> The club emails you to run your account: the link that
          confirms your address, a link to reset or change your password, a notice when your
          password changes, an invitation link when somebody invites you, and, if you add an event
          by calendar invitation, what became of it. It does not send newsletters or promotions.
          Questions or trouble getting an email: <ContactEmail />.
        </P>
        <P>
          <b>A phone number is optional.</b> If you add one, it is only so the host of an event you
          choose Going for can reach you about that event. It is never used to sign you in. How we

      <Section title="Changes">
        <P>
          If these terms change, the date at the top changes with them. Using the club after that
          means you accept the new terms.
