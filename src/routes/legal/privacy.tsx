        <List>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> you can measure distances in Filters from another city, state or ZIP code
            instead of home. What you type is looked up with OpenStreetMap, and the place found is
            kept on your device only (see What we collect).

        <List>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> once a day, on each way you use the club, we note how you are seeing it:
            the kind of browser and its version, the system, the screen’s size, light or dark, and
            whether notifications are allowed. Administrators see this by name, so they can help you
            get the most from the club, such as adding it to your Home Screen. It is kept for 180
            days (see What we collect and How long we keep it).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> administrators see how each member came to the club, by name: the invite
            or QR code that let them in, and whether they asked for one.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> if you were invited at one address and signed in at another, you can have
            a code emailed to the first to prove it is yours. We keep that address and a scrambled
            copy of the code for at most a day after the code runs out (see What we collect and How
            long we keep it).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Changed:</b> asking for an invite no longer means choosing an organization. What you
            send goes to The SCI Club’s org admins, and the page no longer shows anybody’s name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Changed:</b> after you add yourself to an event’s list on its public page, the page
            says whether the address you gave is a member’s, has an invitation, or neither, so you
            know whether to sign in, create your account, or ask for an invite.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> an organization’s org admins can notify its members, mentors and org
            admins of one of its events, and remind them. They see, by name, who it went to, whether
            each opened it, and whether each said Going or Interested. You can turn these
            notifications off on Me.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> we note which events you open in the app. Administrators, and the org
            admins of the event’s organization, see only how many members opened the event page and
            how often, not who. Opening an event’s public page, or tapping its RSVP or Interested,
            adds one to a count for that day, with nothing about who did it.

        <List>
          <li>
            <b>Changed:</b> an org admin or a trusted partner can connect two members without asking
            either of them first. You are added to a group conversation with the other member and
            told who connected you. You can leave it, block or report anyone in it, at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> org admins see what trusted partners see of the people they invited or
            connected, and counts for their organization, such as members, event turnout and reviews
            (see Who can see what).

        <List>
          <li>
            <b>Changed:</b> Join replaces Follow. An organization’s members are shown to other
            members, on its page and on each member’s profile, unless you are hidden from Peers. If
            you followed an organization, you are now its member and in its members’ group chat. You
            can leave at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> joining an organization’s members by pressing Join, by its invite, QR code
            or link, or by checking in to its event. Its org admins see how you joined and can
            decline a membership, saying why. They see that you checked in, and can invite you to
            join, once, by a direct message.

            <b>Added:</b> when you agreed to the Terms of Service and this policy, and to which
            version, is kept with your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Changed:</b> every event has a page anyone with its link can open, whoever in the
            club it is for, so members can invite people to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Changed:</b> when you change a post in a room, anybody who can read the post can see
            what it said before. Once somebody else has replied, you can add words or photographs to
            a post but not change or remove what it already says, or delete it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> trusted partners, professionals who work with people with spinal cord
            injuries, shown with their title. They can introduce two members to each other, and see
            the people they invited or introduced (see Who can see what). Joining, you can say you
            are such a professional; that alone makes nobody a partner.
          </li>

      <Note title="What changed on October 28, 2026">
        <List>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> address suggestions. When an administrator or an organization account
            types a location’s street address, what they type goes to Komoot’s Photon service to
            suggest matching addresses. Members’ information is never sent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Changed:</b> a reaction to your post or message now tells you who reacted, in a
            notification, as a like already did. The app’s icon shows how many kinds of notification
            you have not opened yet, instead of unread conversations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Changed:</b> on the map, a place with one member shows that member’s photograph and
            name, as Peers does.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Changed:</b> the ZIP code you give is now kept, and only you can see it. On the map
            you are counted at the middle of your ZIP code instead of your city’s; other members
            never see the ZIP code itself, but if you are the only member there, your photograph and
            name show at its middle, so they can tell roughly which part of town you live in. Leave
            the ZIP code out, in Your details, to be counted by city only.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> asking for an invite. Somebody without one can send an organization’s org
            admins their name, email address and a note. The page that offers this shows each org
            admin’s first name to anyone who opens it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Changed:</b> an org admin’s QR code or invite link lets in whoever uses it before it
            expires, and its maker is told who joined.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> a link to a post can be shared outside the club. It carries none of the
            post’s words; only members can read the post. The confirmation email now has a code to
            type in the app, as well as its link.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> that the club is not covered by HIPAA, how we keep your information safe
            and what we do if it is ever exposed, when the law can require us to share it, your
            privacy rights wherever you live in the US, and where your information is kept.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> mentions. Typing @ and a member’s username in a post or reply tells them
            who mentioned them, in a notification, and links to their profile.
          </li>

        <List>
          <li>
            <b>Added:</b> the map. Members are counted at the middle of their city, never closer;
            Show me on the map, on Me, leaves you out. Use my location on the map stays on your
            device. Map pictures come from the club’s own copy of OpenStreetMap, served by
            Cloudflare. Event and organization addresses are looked up with OpenStreetMap.

            with Apple, looking up where you live, photographs, notifications, public event pages
            and their guest lists, adding events by calendar invitation, blocking, reporting a
            profile, what administrators can see, how long we keep things, and deleting your account
            by email.

        <P>
          The SCI Club is a private, invite-only community for adults living with spinal cord injury
          and their family members. It is operated by Alfred Shaheen (“we”, “us”). This policy
          covers The SCI Club app and website, and the emails they send.

        <P>
          The club is not a doctor, hospital or health plan, so HIPAA, the US health privacy law,

          app keeps you signed in and remembers settings such as text size, and, if you open a link

          you are. It uses no cookies or outside tools for advertising or analytics.

          When a message or a post has a link in it, the club’s own server visits that page once, to
          show its title and picture under the link, and keeps a copy of the picture. So your phone
          contacts nobody when you read it: the site learns only that the club visited, not who
          posted the link or who read it. Opening the link takes you to that site, under its own
          policy.

      <Section title="Notifications">
        <P>
          Notifications are off until you turn them on, and you can choose which kinds you get on Me
          → Settings. They reach your device through its notification service: Apple’s on an iPhone,
          iPad or Mac, Google’s on Android or in Chrome, or your browser maker’s. A notification can
          show the first words of a message on your lock screen.
        </P>
        <P>
          In the iPhone app, notifications go through Apple Push Notification service, and the
          address we keep is a token for your iPhone. On the website, a notification’s words are
          encrypted so that only your device can read them; in the app they are not, so Apple could
          read them on the way. Once notifications are on, the app’s icon shows how many kinds of
          notification you have not opened yet, such as messages or replies; opening one, or your
          notifications list, clears it.
        </P>
        {/* 20261028980000. */}
        <P>
          For an event you said you are going to, you are also reminded ten minutes before it
          starts, if that kind of notification is on, and we email you the day before: its name,
          when and where it is, and a link to it. The email goes to your account’s address through
          our email provider. You can switch these emails off on Me → Settings.

          When a member mentions your username in a post, you are told who, with the start of the
          post, once for each post. Not by somebody you blocked or who blocked you, and only in a
          room you can read. Mentions in conversations notify nobody.

          <li>
            To show your profile to other members and to suggest peers and mentors to you, using
            things like your injury, your age and where you live.
          </li>
          <li>To show you events, rooms and conversations, and to notify you about them.</li>
          <li>
            To keep the club safe: looking into reports and blocks, and closing an account if
            needed.
          </li>
        </List>
        <P>
          We never use your injury, your health or anything else about you for advertising, and
          never sell it.

      <Section title="Who can see what">
        <List>
          <li>
            <b>Other members</b> see your profile: your name, photograph, injury, age, where you
            live and what you have chosen to share. They never see your email address, your phone
            number or your birthday; your age is worked out from your birthday on our side. You can
            hide yourself from Peers, on Me.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>On the map</b>, other members see how many members live in each place, shown at the
            middle of your ZIP code if you gave one, or of your city, never your address or anything
            closer. A place with one member shows that member’s photograph and name, as Peers does,
            so others can tell roughly which part of town they live in. To be counted by city only,
            leave your ZIP code out. Turn off <b>Show me on the map</b>, on Me, to be left out;
            hiding yourself from Peers leaves you off the map too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Members see some of what you do:</b> who likes or reacts to a post, who is going to
            an event, and, in a conversation you are in, that you have read a message. Liking or
            reacting to a post or a message tells its author who you are, in a notification, and so
            does mentioning a member in a post. A post shows how many people have read it, never
            who.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Members who speak for organizations</b>, such as hospitals and peer support programs,
            see the same profile inside the app as anybody else, to help match members with peers
            and mentors. They see your email address and phone number only on the guest list of an
            event they manage, and only if you RSVP (see Event hosts, below).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Trusted partners</b> are professionals, such as a hospital’s peer support lead or a
            physical therapist, whom an administrator chose. Their title is shown beside their name.
            They see the same profiles as anybody. For the people they invited or connected, they
            also see whether each joined, finished their profile and was introduced to a mentor, and
            how many of them posted in a room or RSVP to an event, as a count. They cannot read
            conversations they are not in. Partners see no email address or phone number, except an
            address they sent an invite to themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Org admins</b> see the same about the people they invited or connected, and counts
            for their organization: members, how they joined, events, turnout and reviews. They see
            everyone in their organization by name, and, for each of its events, whether you said
            Going or Interested and, if they notified you of it, whether you opened the
            notification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Being connected.</b> An org admin or a trusted partner can connect two members. You
            are not asked first: you and the other member are added to a group conversation, which
            opens with a line saying who connected you and their note, and you are told. Whoever
            connected you is in it only if they chose to be, and can read it only then. You can
            leave it, block or report anyone in it, at any time, and you will not be connected to
            the same member twice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Your email address</b> is also seen by whoever invited you, who already had it. If
            you join with a QR code or invite link, whoever made it is told that you joined, and
            sees your profile like any member.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>If you ask for an invite</b>, what you send is seen by The SCI Club’s org admins, and
            nobody else.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>A post you change</b> shows Edited, and anybody who can read it can open its earlier
            versions. Once somebody else has replied to it, you can add words or photographs but not
            change or remove what it already says, or delete it, so the replies still make sense.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Direct and group conversations</b> cannot be read by administrators. If somebody
            reports a single message or post, that one message is shown to administrators, with who
            wrote it and when, and nothing else from the conversation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>What Google or Apple sends us</b> is used only to sign you in. It is not shown to
            other members or to organizations, and it is never shared. Unlink either on Me and it is
            no longer used to sign you in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Photographs</b> are only shown to people signed in to the club. Nobody outside it can

          changes, to remind you, and to look after the people who come. Choosing Interested shares
          nothing. Hosts agree not to use your details for marketing, fundraising or promotions, and
          not to pass them on. The RSVP button says this, and offers Interested instead. Anybody in
          the club who manages the event sees them on its guest list; for other hosts, an

          shares your name, email address and phone number, if you give it, with the club’s
          administrators and anybody in the club who manages that event, for that event only. It
          does not register you with the host. The guest list also says whether the address belongs
          to a member, or to somebody joining. The page then says what comes next for that address:
          sign in if it is a member’s, create your account if it has an invitation, or ask for one.
          If you then sign in or join with that address, it becomes your Going or Interested, and

          The SCI Club is for people 18 and over. We do not knowingly collect information from

      <Section title="Deleting your account">
        <P>
          You can delete your account yourself, from <b>Me → Account → Delete my account</b>. That
          erases your name, username, email address, phone number, photograph, birthday, injury, any
          Google or Apple account you linked, everything you answered about yourself, and your
          likes, reactions, saves, follows, replies to events, blocks and notifications, and your
          sign-in records with their email and IP addresses, and takes your address off the invite
          list. If you signed in with Apple, we also ask Apple to end the club’s Sign in with Apple.
        </P>
        <P>
          What you wrote in Chat, and the photographs you shared there, stay, so other people’s
          conversations still make sense, but they say “Deleted member” instead of your name. The
          other person in a one-to-one conversation can then delete it, with everything both of you
          wrote and every photograph in it. A report keeps its copy of the reported words, with
          nobody named. A report of your profile keeps what you wrote on it, but your name,
          @username and photograph go from it. Details already passed to an event’s host stay with
          that host. A registration on an event’s public page stays until 90 days after the event,
          and a calendar invitation you sent keeps the address it came from.

          If you cannot sign in, or are an administrator, email <ContactEmail /> to ask us to delete
          your account, or for a copy of what we hold about you. Write from the address on your
          account if you can. We delete it by hand and reply when it is done. You can also correct
          anything about you on Me.{' '}
