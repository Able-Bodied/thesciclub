/**
 * The card under a link: its page's picture and title (the owner,
 * 2026-10-06), in a conversation, a room and on Home.
 *
 * Everything on it was read by the club when the words were written
 * (20261006010000), and the picture is the club's own copy, signed like a
 * photograph in Chat. So drawing the card tells the linked site nothing.
 *
 * A YouTube video plays where it is, on a press and not before: the button
 * swaps the picture for YouTube's privacy-enhanced player, which is the
 * first moment anything reaches YouTube. Everything else, Instagram included
 * at the owner's choice, opens its page in a new tab the way the link in the
 * words does.
 *
 * The picture's box has its shape before the picture arrives, so a card
 * filling in does not push the conversation about (see lib/hold-scroll.ts).
 * The picture itself says nothing the title does not, so it is decorative to
 * a screen reader; the link's name is the title and the site.
