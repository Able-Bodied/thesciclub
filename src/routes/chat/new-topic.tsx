/**
 * Starting a topic: a title and the first post itself.
 *
 * `chat_create_topic` writes both in one transaction, so the body is an ordinary post. A topic is
 * not always a question (the owner, 2026-09-20): tips and lists are topics too, so the copy never
 * asks "what are you asking?".
 *
 * On refusal the fields stay and the screen does not navigate; the database's own sentence is
 * shown, since it says something useful (not a member, room closed).
 *
 * /home/new hands over with `{ from: 'home', segment, kind }`, reusing this screen so a topic is
 * written one way. Back says "Home" and returns to the member's pill, as does the posted topic's.
 * `kind: 'share'` puts the photograph picker first and makes words optional once there is one
 * (`chat_posts_check`); the title stays required, as it is the room's list line. Asking changes
 * only the back link.
