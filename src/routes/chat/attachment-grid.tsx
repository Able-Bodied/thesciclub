/**
 * The photographs on a message or a post, opened in PhotoViewer (src/components/photo-viewer.tsx).
 *
 * One photo at its own shape (max 20rem tall); two to four as squares. The viewer shows the stored
 * 1,600px copy, enough to read a label or see a wound. Only Home passes `fill` (fixed-width cards);
 * a bubble fits what it holds. No tile background (owner, 2026-09-23): it letterboxed photos.
 *
 * Alt text is "Photograph N of M from <name>"; the message is the description, since nobody is
 * asked to describe a photo on the way in. A path the reader's token cannot sign (refused or
 * deleted) is not drawn, rather than a tile claiming a photo the reader cannot see.
