/**
 * The five-tab bottom bar, matching `nav()` in docs/index.html.
 *
 * Every tab is a real screen. Home was the last placeholder, and was in the bar
 * from the start because leaving a hole there would have moved every other tab
 * once it landed. Since 2026-09-30 it is also where the app opens: `/` goes to
 * Home, so the first tab is the first screen. Until then `/` went to Peers,
 * while Home was built in steps and seen on the live club.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Chat is still not raised, and now carries a dot
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The mock gives the middle tab a badge behind its icon and this bar carried it
 * for a while. It was removed because the badge is the strongest mark in the
 * nav and it sat on the one tab that did nothing — the bar pointed hardest at
 * the only place with nothing to find.
 *
 * Chat is real now, and the raised tab still does not come back. A permanent
 * badge says "this is the important one" on every screen forever; a dot says
 * "somebody has written to you", which is a fact, and it disappears when it
 * stops being true. A count is not drawn: three unread conversations and one
 * are the same instruction, and the number would be the loudest thing in the
 * bar.
