/**
 * The membership is paused, and the person it belongs to is told so.
 *
 * Suspension existed in the database and in `/admin` from the beginning and
 * did nothing a member could perceive: the row was read without its status, so
 * a suspended member resolved to an ordinary one and walked in. What they
 * found was an empty Peers deck and no events — `browse_members` and the
 * event views filter on status — with nothing anywhere saying why. A club
 * whose stated sanction is losing membership cannot apply it invisibly.
 *
 * Written as a pause, not an error, and not as an accusation. It is reversible
 * by design — `/admin` has Reactivate beside Suspend — so the copy says that
 * plainly rather than reading like a verdict.
 *
 * Who to ask is the part that has to be true. There is no messaging in the
 * club (CONTEXT.md), so rather than invent a contact route this names whoever
 * vouched for them, which `my_invited_by()` will answer for a suspended member
 * as readily as an active one. When it answers nothing, the screen says less
 * rather than pointing somewhere wrong — the same rule the blocked screen
 * follows about naming organizations.
