 * is still there to come back to. `nofollow ugc` because a member wrote it,
 * not the club; `noreferrer` because where a member read it is nobody else's
 * business.
 *
 * The colour is inherited and the underline carries it, so the same link reads
 * on a navy bubble and on paper without a second palette to keep above AA.
 * `overflow-wrap: anywhere` because a shortened label can still be one long
 * word on a 320px screen.
 *
 * An @username of a member with a profile links to it, as in a post
 * (the owner, 2026-10-31). Other @names stay words.
