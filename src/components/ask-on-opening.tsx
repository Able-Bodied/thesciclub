/**
 * The first time the club is opened from the Home Screen, "Turn on
 * notifications?" before anything else (the owner, 2026-10-05). Why, and what
 * "the first time" means: `askOnOpening` in src/lib/push/notifications.ts.
 *
 * Since 2026-10-14 the only place it is asked unprompted: signing up no
 * longer asks, because most people join in a browser before installing.
 * NotificationsStep remembers that this phone has been asked. Decided once, on the first render: the facts are
 * synchronous, so a member who is not asked never sees this flash past.
 *
 * The iPhone app reads its permission from iOS, which answers asynchronously:
 * nothing is drawn for that moment. Its first launch never asks.
