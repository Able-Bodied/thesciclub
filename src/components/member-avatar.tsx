 * One member's face, wherever a member appears beside their name.
 *
 * Extracted from `routes/events/attendee-avatar.tsx`, which was the second
 * copy of the Peers deck's tile and is now a thin wrapper over this. Chat needs
 * a third — posts, bubbles and the stack of faces on a topic row — and three
 * copies of the same 34px square is how somebody ends up purple on their
 * profile and green on an event.
 *
 * It takes the four fields it draws rather than a domain type, because the
 * three callers have three different types (`EventAttendee`, `BrowseMember`,
 * `ChatAuthor`) that agree on exactly these. A shared component that named one
 * of them would make the other two convert.

 * already made — the list signs every group's at once rather than one request
 * a row. No URL, or one that has not arrived yet, is the glyph.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in a file of its own because this is the one tile
 * file: the alternative is a fourth 34px square drawn somewhere else, which is
 * how somebody ends up purple on their profile and green on an event.
