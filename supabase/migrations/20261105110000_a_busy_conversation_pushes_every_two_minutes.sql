-- ============================================================================
-- A busy conversation pushes once every two minutes
-- ============================================================================
-- The owner, 2026-11-05: sending a message was ~12% of Pro's database time
-- under load, as every message pushed to everybody else and counted each
-- one's icon number. The bell, the Chat dot and realtime are unchanged; only
-- pushes for conversation messages change:
--
--   1. No push to a member whose read position in the conversation moved in
--      the last 30 s: they are in it now.
--   2. At most one push per member per conversation every 2 minutes while it
--      stays unread. The next one says how many are new (detail). Reading
--      resets it: the read row closes and the next message makes a new one.
--   3. The icon number is counted only for a push that goes; and with no push
--      owed, push_notify_send sends no request at all.
--
-- Kept on the notification row each member already upserts (pushed_at,
-- pushed_message), so a message writes nothing more than before. The message
-- is recorded on its own, out of the list of every kind: planning that list
-- was most of a message's cost (10-20 ms locally; now about 1 ms).
--
-- Deploy order is free: today's push-notify ignores detail for a message and
-- says the latest one as before; the new compose.ts says "5 new messages".
--
-- Replies, likes, reactions, mentions and every other kind: unchanged.
-- Anyone restating notifications_record or push_owed keeps pushed_* or
-- messages stop pushing (probe: busy-conversation-pushes.sql).
--
-- push_owed as 20261105020000 left it (a group's name as subject).
-- Undo: supabase/undo/20261105110000.sql.
