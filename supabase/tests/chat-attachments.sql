-- READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A STORAGE STEP
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The bucket's *read* policy is the load-bearing part of 20260918200000 and
-- it is exercised here — a row can be put in storage.objects as the superuser
-- and then selected as a member, and RLS decides. Uploads and deletes cannot
-- be: `storage.protect_delete()` refuses every direct delete before RLS is
-- consulted, and an insert as a member does not go through the API's own
-- checks (the size limit, the mime types). Those are proved through the API
-- with real tokens by `pnpm check-chat-photo-policy`, which is the other half
-- of this file. See supabase/tests/photo-cleanup.sql for the afternoon that
-- taught this.
--
-- Two steps carry the feature and are marked in place:
--
--   6  — somebody outside a direct conversation cannot read a photograph in
--        it. **THE step.** chat_file_is_readable() is definer, so the select
--        policy on chat_messages is protecting nothing here; the
--        is_thread_member() line inside it is the entire defence between a
--        picture of somebody's pressure sore and every member with a URL.
--   9  — an administrator can read a photograph only once it is named on a
--        report, and not before. Sabotage chat_file_is_reported() to `true`
--        and step 9a must go red.
--
-- Step 0 prints current_user because as the superuser every step below turns
-- green while proving nothing. Every expected refusal has its own savepoint.
