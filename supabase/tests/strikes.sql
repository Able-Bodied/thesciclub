-- ============================================================================
-- Do strikes count what they should, and can the wrong people see them?
-- ============================================================================
-- Two halves. The arithmetic — withdrawn strikes and old strikes leave the
-- count, and the row stays — and the visibility, which is the half that would
-- do real harm if it were wrong: a strike is the most sensitive thing that
-- could sit against a name, and no member may see another's.
--
-- Run as real signed-in roles, not as the superuser: postgres is BYPASSRLS, so
-- every policy here would be inert and the file would pass while proving
-- nothing. Every expected refusal sits in its own savepoint, or the first one
-- aborts the transaction and the rest report nothing at all.
