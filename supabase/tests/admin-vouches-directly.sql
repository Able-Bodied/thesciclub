-- An administrator inviting in their own name
-- ============================================================================
-- Run as a signed-in administrator, because every rule here lives inside a
-- SECURITY DEFINER function that checks is_admin() and reads auth.uid().
--
--   docker run --rm -i --network host -e PGPASSWORD=postgres postgres:17-alpine \
--     psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres \
--     -f - < supabase/tests/admin-vouches-directly.sql
--
-- Rolls back. Reads verification through `admin_invites`, never through
-- `public.invites`: an administrator has no select policy on that table, so
-- querying it here would return nothing whatever the function did. Three
-- probes in this directory have been caught by that.
--
-- Since 20261012000000 an invite names an email address. The old steps about
-- attaching a seeded-profile claim are gone with the claim itself (the
-- seeded directory was removed in 20261010020000 and the consume trigger no
-- longer has the branch).
