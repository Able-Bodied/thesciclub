-- ============================================================================
-- Can a member turn notifications on for a device, and can anybody else see
-- or send to it?
-- ============================================================================
-- Step 5 is the one that matters: a subscription is an address that reaches a
-- member's lock screen, and the select policy is what keeps one member from
-- reading another's. Step 7 is the second: a device that changes hands must
-- stop notifying the member who handed it over.
--
-- Run as real signed-in roles, not as the superuser: postgres is BYPASSRLS, so
-- every policy here would be inert and the file would pass while proving
-- nothing. Every expected refusal sits in its own savepoint, or the first one
-- aborts the transaction and the rest print "current transaction is aborted",
-- which in a long log is indistinguishable from passing.
--
--   docker run --rm -i --network host -e PGPASSWORD=postgres postgres:17-alpine \
